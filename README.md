# Roulette Simulation using the Monte Carlo Method
----
The Monte Carlo method works by using a known probability distribution and drawing from it a specified number of times. To explore this concept, I created a simulation of a roulette game where one bets either black or red. This basic statistics problem has been solved many times over; the chances of winning in an U.S. style roulette are 18/38. So we can calculate our expected value the following way:

```
E(X)  = âˆ‘X * P(X)
E_blackOrRed = (18/38)(5) + (20/38)(-5) = -0.263158
```

In this project I explore how close I can get to this value in a simulation and how using a popular betting method affects the expected outcome.
